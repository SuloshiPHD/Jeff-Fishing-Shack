# Jeff-Fishing-Shack
A self serving desktop application that can be displayed in large display unit, created using javafx.
Here I implement an application for Jeffâ€™s fishing shack. As the second step I convert my design to implementation. I use javaFX to implement all the functionalities identified in the design part. And also implement java collection framework. For example, implement arraylist and linkedlist. Furthermore, I use selection sort and binary search to find the maximum product quantity. Moreover, I use object oriented programming concepts and implement database.
